Sample data to run BEFDR

Example data needed to run function BEFDR function

}
\usage{data("Chicken")}
\format{
  A .RData object contains several vecotrs and data.frames
  \describe{
    \item{\code{sigMrk}}{ a vector of SNPs that captures the polygenic backgroud, so I would like to keep them as fixed effect, which means they will be kept in the minimal model}
    \item{\code{mrksT}}{a  set of markers I want to do BE on}
    \item{\code{mrk_geno}}{ is a genotype matrix}
    \item{\code{phe}}{ a vector contains phenotype}
    \item{\code{phe}}{ fx1 is a vector contains sex}
    \item{\code{mrk_info}}{ a matrix contains the name and location of all the marker}
